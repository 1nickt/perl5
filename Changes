             Remove all the now unused new_XFOO()/del_XFOO() macros
             
             [ 26172]
             With -DPURFIY we change the flags so that everything is allocated
             directly. (Don't use arenas at all.) This seems a rather elegant way
             to simplify some of the code in sv.c by removing conditional
             compilation.
             
             [ 26173]
             Norman observed that a couple of macros could make the body defintion
             table a lot more readable.

             Flip the sign of the value in body details offset, and change its type

             Eliminate a croak we can't get to.
             
             [ 27091]
             Merge and refactor the PVAV and PVHV code in Perl_sv_upgrade, which
             reduces the object size by about 80 bytes.
             
             [ 27092]
             Remove "Can't upgrade to undef" from perldiag, as the corresponding
             code is now gone from sv_upgrade.
             
             [ 27094]
             new_body_type doesn't need to subtract the offset, that's what
             new_body_allocated is for.
             
             [ 27095]
             The message "Can't upgrade that kind of scalar" can be far more
             informative.
             
             [ 27109]
             In Perl_sv_upgrade, the assignment to new_type_details only needs to

             sv_clear can manipulate the arena array directly too.
             Also, I think that we may have been "leaking" NV bodies in blead since
             25051. Oops. (Will not have been detectable except with -DPURIFY as
             the leak is not returning them as free to the arena)

             Merge the arms of the switch. The decision about what comes from an
             arena and what comes from malloc is now solely in the table.
             
             [ 26168]
             We only need to zero new bodies for upgrades. sv_dup doesn't need to
             zero as it's copying over the same sized structure. So change
             new_NOARENA to malloc(), and add new_NOARENAZ() to calloc()
             
             [ 26378]
             Perl_sv_dup should be allocating bodies based on *size*, not the

             Add a new macro new_NOARENA() for allocating the non-arena types.

             Inlining del_HE is actually a space optimisation.
             It's therefore likely also to be a speed optimisation. :-)

             The if() clause is the wrong way round, so OOK can never be true in
             this case. Given that OOK is never undone, we could never have been
             correctly upgrading a PV with OOK to HV or AV. I believe that only
             SVt_NULL is the only type ever upgraded to HV or AV.
