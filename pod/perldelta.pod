=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.8.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.8.0 release and
the 5.8.1 release.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 Tied Arrays with Negative Array Indices

Formerly, the indices passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>, C<EXISTS>, and
C<DELETE> methods in tied array class were always non-negative.  If
the actual argument was negative, Perl would call FETCHSIZE implicitly
and add the result to the index before passing the result to the tied
array method.  This behavior is now optional.  If the tied array class
contains a package variable named C<$NEGATIVE_INDICES> which is set to
a true value, negative values will be passed to C<FETCH>, C<STORE>,
C<EXISTS>, and C<DELETE> unchanged.

=head2 Warnings

Perl 5.8.0 forgot to add some deprecation warnings.  These warnings
have now been added.

=head2 Pseudo-hashes really are deprecated

Pseudo-hashes were deprecated in Perl 5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl
5.10.0, see L<perl58delta> for details.  Each attempt to access pseudo-hashes
will trigger the warning C<Pseudo-hashes are deprecated>.  If you really want
to continue using pseudo-hashes but not to see the deprecation warnings, add:

    no warnings 'deprecated';

Or you can continue to use the L<fields> pragma, but please don't
expect the data structures to be pseudohashes any more.

=head2 5.005-style threads really are deprecated

5.005-style threads (activated by C<use Thread;>) were deprecated in Perl
5.8.0 and will be removed in Perl 5.10.0, see L<perl58delta> for details.
Each attempt to create a 5.005-style thread will trigger the warning
C<5.005 threads are deprecated>.  If you really want to continue using
5.005 threads but not to see the deprecation warnings, add:

    no warnings 'deprecated';
