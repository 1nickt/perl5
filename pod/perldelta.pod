=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.20.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.20.0 release and the 5.20.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.19.0, first read
L<perl5200delta>, which describes differences between 5.19.0 and 5.20.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See L</Reporting Bugs>
below.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here.
There may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

An optimization to avoid problems with COW and deliberately overallocated PVs
has been disabled because it interfered with another, more important,
optimization, causing a slowdown on some platforms.
L<[perl #121975]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121975>

=item *

Returning a string from a lexical variable could be slow in some cases.  This
has now been fixed.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=item *

L<PerlIO::via> has been upgraded from version 0.14 to 0.15.

separator has been changed.  Version parsing has been patched to ensure it
handles the locales correctly.

C<av_len> - Emphasize that this returns the highest index in the array, not the
size of the array.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

XXX Changes to F<Configure>, F<installperl>, F<installman>, and analogous tools
go here.  Any other changes to the Perl build process should be listed here.
However, any platform-specific changes should be listed in the
L</Platform Support> section, instead.

Building Perl no longer writes to the source tree when configured with

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).

changes as paragraphs below it. ]

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

XXX List any changes for specific platforms.  This could include configuration
and compilation changes or changes in portability/compatibility.  However,
changes within modules for platforms should generally be listed in the
L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=item Android

Build support has been improved for cross-compiling in general and for Android
in particular.

=item OpenBSD

Corrected architectures and version numbers used in configuration hints when
building Perl.

=item Solaris

B<c99> options have been cleaned up, hints look for B<solstudio> as well as
B<SUNWspro>, and support for native C<setenv> has been added.

=item VMS

An old bug in feature checking, mainly affecting pre-7.3 systems, has been
fixed.

item Windows

C<%I64d> is now being used instead of C<%lld> for MinGW.

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

XXX Changes which affect the interface available to C<XS> code go here.  Other
significant internal changes for future core maintainers should be noted as
well.

[ List each change as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Added L<perlapi/sync_locale>.
Changing the program's locale should be avoided by XS code.  Nevertheless,
certain non-Perl libraries called from XS, such as C<Gtk> do so.  When this
happens, Perl needs to be told that the locale has changed.  Use this function
to do so, before returning to Perl.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarized here.  Bug fixes in
files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarized in L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=item *

A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside of a
regex could cause C<pos> to see an incorrect value.
L<[perl #122460]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460>

=item *

Using C<s///e> on tainted utf8 strings could issue bogus "Malformed UTF-8
character (unexpected end of string)" warnings.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #122148]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148>

=item *

C<system> and friends should now work properly on more Android builds.

Due to an oversight, the value specified through B<-Dtargetsh> to F<Configure>
would end up being ignored by some of the build process.  This caused perls
cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective versions of C<system>,
C<exec> and backticks: the commands would end up looking for F</bin/sh>
instead of F</system/bin/sh>, and so would fail for the vast majority of
devices, leaving C<$!> as C<ENOENT>.

=item *

Many issues have been detected by L<Coverity|http://www.coverity.com/> and 
fixed.

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed
platform specific bugs also go here.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
