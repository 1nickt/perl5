=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.16.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.16.1 release and
the 5.16.2 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.16.0, first read
L<perl5161delta>, which describes differences between 5.16.0 and
5.16.1.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.16.0
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version 0.69 to version 0.70.

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item * configuration should no longer be confused by ls colorization

=back

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item AIX

Configure now always adds -qlanglvl=extc99 to the CC flags on AIX when
using xlC.  This will make it easier to compile a number of XS-based modules
that assume C99 [perl #113778].

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item * fix /\h/ equivalence with /[\h]/

see [perl #114220]

=head1 Known Problems

There are no new known problems.

=head1 Acknowledgements

XXX Generate this with:

  perl Porting/acknowledgements.pl v5.16.1..HEAD

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes
all the core committers, who will be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
