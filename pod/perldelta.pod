=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.14.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.14.0 release and
the 5.14.1 release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first read
L<perl5140delta>, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
5.14.0.

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here. Summarise user-visible core language
enhancements. Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.0. If any
exist, they are bugs and reports are welcome.

=head1 Deprecations

There have been no deprecations since 5.12.0.

=head1 Performance Enhancements

XXX Changes which enhance performance without changing behaviour go here. There
may well be none in a stable release.

[ List each enhancement as a =item entry ]

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

[ Within each section, list entries as a =item entry ]

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<B::Deparse> has been upgraded from version 1.03 to 1.04, to address two
regressions in Perl 5.14.0:

Deparsing of the C<glob> operator and its diamond (C<< <> >>) form now
works again. [perl #90898]

The presence of subroutines named C<::::> or C<::::::> no longer causes
B::Deparse to hang.

=item *

L<Pod::Perldoc> has been upgraded from version 3.15_03 to 3.15_04.

It corrects the search paths on VMS. [perl #90640]

=item *

The C<<< <<\FOO >>> here-doc syntax has been documented.

=back

=head3 L<perlrun>

=head1 Utility Changes

XXX Changes to installed programs such as F<perlbug> and F<xsubpp> go

[ List utility changes as a =head3 entry for each utility and =item
entries for each change

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

XXX Changes to F<Configure>, F<installperl>, F<installman>, and analogous tools
go here.  Any other changes to the Perl build process should be listed here.
However, any platform-specific changes should be listed in the
L</Platform Support> section, instead.

[ List changes as a =item entry ].

=item *

F<regexp.h> has been modified for compatibility with GCC's B<-Werror>
option, as used by some projects that include perl's header files.

=head1 Testing

=over 4

=item *

Some test failures in F<dist/Locale-Maketext/t/09_compile.t> that could
occur depending on the environment have been fixed. [perl #89896]

=item * 

A watchdog timer for F<t/re/re.t> was lengthened to accommodate SH-4 systems
which were unable to complete the tests before the previous timer ran out.

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

XXX List any changes for specific platforms. This could include configuration

=head3 Solaris

=over 

=item *

Documentation listing the Solaris packages required to build Perl on
Solaris 9 and Solaris 10 has been corrected.

=back

=head3 Mac OS X

paths on Ubuntu natty.

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=item *

The compiled representation of formats is now stored via the mg_ptr of
their PERL_MAGIC_fm. Previously it was stored in the string buffer,
beyond SvLEN(), the regular end of the string. SvCOMPILED() and
SvCOMPILED_{on,off}() now exist solely for compatibility for XS code.
The first is always 0, the other two now no-ops.

=back

=head1 Bug Fixes

XXX Important bug fixes in the core language are summarised here.
Bug fixes in files in F<ext/> and F<lib/> are best summarised in
L</Modules and Pragmata>.

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

A bug has been fixed that would cause a "Use of freed value in iteration"
error if the next two hash elements that would be iterated over are
deleted. [perl #85026]

=item *

Passing the same constant subroutine to both C<index> and C<formline> no
longer causes one or the other to fail. [perl #89218]

=item *

5.14.0 introduced some memory leaks in regular expression character
classes such as C<[\w\s]>, which have now been fixed.

=item *

An edge case in regular expression matching could potentially loop.
This happened only under C</i> in bracketed character classes that have
characters with multi-character folds, and the target string to match
against includes the first portion of the fold, followed by another
character that has a multi-character fold that begins with the remaining
portion of the fold, plus some more.

 "s\N{U+DF}" =~ /[\x{DF}foo]/i

is one such case.  C<\xDF> folds to C<"ss">.

=item * 

Several Unicode case-folding bugs have been fixed.

=item *

The new (in 5.14.0) regular expression modifier C</a> when repeated like
C</aa> forbids the characters outside the ASCII range that match
characters inside that range from matching under C</i>.  This did not
work under some circumstances, all involving alternation, such as:

 "\N{KELVIN SIGN}" =~ /k|foo/iaa;

succeeded inaprropriately.  This is now fixed.

=back

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here. Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here, unless
they were specific to a particular platform (see below).

This is a list of some significant unfixed bugs, which are regressions
from either 5.XXX.XXX or 5.XXX.XXX.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be
information at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug>
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of C<perl -V>, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on CPAN.
