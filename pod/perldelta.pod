=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.19.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.19.8 release and the 5.19.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.19.7, first read
L<perl5198delta>, which describes differences between 5.19.7 and 5.19.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

=head2 C<S<use locale>> now compiles on systems without locale ability

Previously doing this caused the program to not compile.  Within its
scope the program behaves as if in the "C" locale.  Thus programs
written for platforms that support locales can run on locale-less
platforms without change.  Attempts to change the locale away from the
"C" locale will, of course, fail.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item *

The cross-compilation model has been renovated.
There's several new options, and some backwards-incompatible changes:

We now build binaries for miniperl and generate_uudmap to be used on the host, rather than running
every miniperl call on the target; this means that, short of 'make test',
we no longer need access to the target system once Configure is done.
You can provide already-built binaries through the C<hostperl> and
C<hostgenerate> options to Configure.

Additionally, if targeting an EBCDIC platform from an ASCII host,
or viceversa, you'll need to run Configure with C<-Uhostgenerate>, to
indicate that generate_uudmap should be run on the target.

Finally, there's also a way of having Configure end early, right after
building the host binaries, by cross-compiling without specifying a
C<targethost>.

The incompatible changes include no longer using xconfig.h, xlib, or
Cross.pm, so canned config files and Makefiles will have to be updated.

=item *

Related to the above, there is now a way of specifying the location of sh
(or equivalent) on the target system: C<targetsh>.

For example, Android has its sh in /system/bin/sh, so if cross-compiling
from a more normal Unixy system with sh in /bin/sh, "targetsh" would end
up as /system/bin/sh, and "sh" as /bin/sh.

=head1 Testing

XXX Any significant changes to the testing of a freshly built perl should be
listed here.  Changes which create B<new> files in F<t/> go here as do any
large changes to the testing harness (e.g. when parallel testing was added).
Changes to existing files in F<t/> aren't worth summarizing, although the bugs
that they represent may be covered elsewhere.

=head2 New Platforms

XXX List any platforms that this version of perl compiles on, that previous
versions did not.  These will either be enabled by new files in the F<hints/>
directories, or new subdirectories and F<README> files at the top level of the
source tree.

=item XXX-some-platform

=item *

By default, Perl will only create a shell subprocess for system(), backticks
etc, if you use shell metacharacters in your shell command. Some operating
systems (e.g. Android) do not install the separate echo or pwd binaries,
which breaks the assumptions of not only the core tests, but also large
parts of CPAN; In these cases, we can force perl to always spawn a
shell by building it with the -Duseshellcmds.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
