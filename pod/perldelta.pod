=item *

AIX now sets the length in C<< getsockopt >> correctly.
L<[perl #120835]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835>,
L<[cpan #91183]|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183>,
L<[cpan #85570]|https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570>

=item *

In Perl 5.20.0, C<$^N> accidentally had the internal UTF8 flag turned off
if accessed from a code block within a regular expression, effectively
UTF8-encoding the value.  This has been fixed.
L<[perl #123135]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123135>

=item *

Various cases where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading, error
messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have been fixed.

=item *

An assertion failure when parsing C<sort> with debugging enabled has been
fixed.
L<[perl #122771]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122771>

=item *

Loading UTF8 tables during a regular expression match could cause assertion
failures under debugging builds if the previous match used the very same
regular expression.
L<[perl #122747]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747>

=item *

Due to a mistake in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state
variable could instead steal the value and undefine the variable.  This
bug, introduced in 5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250 chars
or more), but could happen for any strings under builds with copy-on-write
disabled.
L<[perl #123029]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123029>

=item *

Fixed a bug that could cause perl to execute an infite loop during
compilation.
L<[perl #122995]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122995>

=item *

On Win32, restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was
C<local()>ed in a parent pseudo-process before the C<fork> happened caused
memory corruption and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore OS
process).
L<[perl #40565]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40565>

=item *

Tainted constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated
statements to become tainted.
L<[perl #122669]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122669>

=item *

Calling C<write> on a format with a C<^**> field could produce a panic
in sv_chop() if there were insufficient arguments or if the variable
used to fill the field was empty.
L<[perl #123245]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123245>

=item *

In perl 5.20.0, C<sort CORE::fake> where 'fake' is anything other than a
keyword started chopping of the last 6 characters and treating the result
as a sort sub name.  The previous behaviour of treating "CORE::fake" as a
sort sub name has been restored.
L<[perl #123410]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410>

=item *

A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and
other crashes has been fixed.  This occurred only in patterns compiled
with C<"/i">, while taking into account the current POSIX locale (this usually
means they have to be compiled within the scope of C<S<"use locale">>),
and there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match.
L<[perl #123539]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123539>

=item *

C<qr/@array(?{block})/> no longer dies with "Bizarre copy of ARRAY".
L<[perl #123344]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123344>

=item *

C<gmtime> no longer crashes with not-a-number values.
L<[perl #123495]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123495>

=item *

Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as C<< s/${<>{})// >>, would
crash, and had done so since Perl 5.10.  (In some cases the crash did not
start happening till 5.16.)  The crash has, of course, been fixed.
L<[perl #123542]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123542>

=item *

A memory leak in some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has been
fixed.
L<[perl #123198]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123198>

=item *

C<< formline("@...", "a"); >> would crash.  The C<FF_CHECKNL> cas in
pp_formline() didn't set the pointer used to mark the chop position,
which led to the C<FF_MORE> case crashing with a segmentation fault.
This has been fixed.
L<[perl #123538]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123538>

A regression has been fixed that was introduced in v5.20.0 (fixed in

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
