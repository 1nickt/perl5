=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.17.9

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.17.8 release and the 5.17.9
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.17.7, first read
L<perl5178delta>, which describes differences between 5.17.7 and 5.17.8.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Interpolations now Accepted in Regular Expression Set Operations

Perl v5.17.8 introduced L<regular expression set operations|perlre/(?[ ])>.
They have now been expanded to allow the interpolation of a
previously-compiled set into a bigger set, like this:

 my $thai_or_lao = qr/\p{Thai} + \p{Lao}/;
 ...
 qr/(?[ \p{Digit} & $thai_or_lao ])/;

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.  In
particular, deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed as
an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

[ List each deprecation as a =head2 entry ]

=head2 Deprecated Modules

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and should be installed from CPAN instead. Distributions
on CPAN which require these should add them to their prerequisites. The
core versions of these modules C<warnings> will issue a deprecation warning.

You can silence these deprecation warnings by installing the modules
in question from CPAN.

=head3 Deprecated Utilities

future release as their associated modules have been deprecated. They
will remain available with the applicable CPAN distribution.

=item C<cpanp-run-perl>

=item L<pod2latex>

The L<Pod::LaTeX> module was deprecated with 5.17.8.

=back

=head2 Five additional characters should be escaped in patterns with C</x>

When a regular expression pattern is compiled with C</x>, Perl treats 6
characters as white space to ignore, such as SPACE and TAB.  However,
Unicode recommends 11 characters be treated thusly.  In preparation to
conforming with this in a future Perl version, in the meantime, use of
any of the missing characters will raise a deprecation warning, unless
turned off.  The five characters are:
U+0085 NEXT LINE,
U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK,
U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK,
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR,
and
U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>
go here.  If Module::CoreList is updated, generate an initial draft of the
following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>, which prints stub
entries to STDOUT.  Results can be pasted in place of the '=head2' entries
below.  A paragraph summary for important changes should then be added by hand.
In an ideal world, dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be
cribbed.

=head2 New Modules and Pragmata

L<Config::Perl::V> version 0.16 has been added as a dual-lifed module.

L<Benchmark> has been upgraded from version 1.13 to 1.14.

L<File::Temp> has been upgraded from version 0.22 to 0.22_90

Fixes various bugs involving directory removal.  Defers unlinking tempfiles if
the initial unlink fails, which fixes problems on NFS.

L<PerlIO::scalar> has been upgraded from version 0.15 to 0.16.

The buffer scalar supplied may now only contain code pounts 0xFF or
lower. [perl #109828]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
