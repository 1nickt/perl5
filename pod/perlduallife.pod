=head1 NAME

perlduallife - Maintaining a dual-lived distribution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the owner's manual for a dual-lived module, and expands on
L<perlpolicy> and L<perlrepository>. 

=head2 About dual-lived modules

A dual-lived module has two tracks of developmentâ€”one in the perl
sources and one on CPAN. This typically allows you to install a newer
version from CPAN without installing a later perl, or update a module
without changing the perl sources. Which one you use depends on the
interest in the distribution. An active distribution with dedicated
maintainers probably wants to move at their own schedule and sync with
perl at set times, so it lives primarily on CPAN. A stable
distribution with few or minor changes and without a dedicated
maintainer might do better inside the perl repository.
