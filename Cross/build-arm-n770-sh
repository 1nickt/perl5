# this is a build script for ARM-linux cross-compiling.
#
# Cross-compiling SDK could be downloaded from the URL
#   http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm
# or alternatively from
#   http://www.handhelds.org/download/projects/toolchain/
#
# SDK also could be downloaded from www.maemo.org, somehow (how - TBD)
#
# Cross-compile process similar to Perl-CE cross-compiling, and allows
# for full TARGET perl (as opposed to renamed miniperl)
#
# some trick is different, however - the file extension for objects files
# are choosen to be .${CROSS_NAME}, .armo in our case

# to skip Configure/build for HOST miniperl, pass "noconf" argument to this script

# note how invoked Makefile.PL for cross-compilation:
#   miniperl -MCross Makefile.PL

# steps are:
# - run HOST configure
# - build HOST miniperl
# given freshly-created HOST makefile and existing miniperl fix makefile
# to use
